                at first, choose a difficulty and a name, <br>
                if you do not choose, by default the difficulty will be easy and the name will be "Gertrude" <br>
                You can choose different language ! <br>
                A word is randomly selected by the website. <br>
                The guessing player is given only 10 chances to correctly guess the word. <br>
                The guessing player guesses letters, one at a time, by typing them into a designated field.<br>
                Incorrect guesses are indicated by displaying the letters already used.<br>
                For each incorrect letter, <br>
                a part of a stick figure is drawn and -1 life will be subtracted to player and For each incorrect word,<br>
                -2 life will be subtracted to player. <br>
                If the stick figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed, <br>
                the guessing player loses and the game is over. <br>
                If the word is guessed before the stick figure is fully drawn, <br>
                the guessing player wins and get the point corresponding to the remaining chance. <br>
                There is a mod clue for the difficult difficulty, each player will have 1 clue since the words can be complex to guess
