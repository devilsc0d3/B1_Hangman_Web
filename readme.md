# Hangman Web

****

**Rules :**

A word or phrase is randomly selected by the website or platform, or chosen by the host player.
The guessing player is given only 10 chances to correctly guess the word or phrase.
The guessing player guesses letters, one at a time, by typing them into a designated field or clicking on them on a virtual keyboard.
Incorrect guesses are indicated by displaying the letters that have been guessed and marking the ones that are not in the word or phrase.
For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn and -2 point will be subtracted to player score
If the stick figure is fully drawn before the word or phrase is guessed, the guessing player loses and the game is over.
If the word or phrase is guessed before the stick figure is fully drawn, the guessing player wins and get the point corresponding to the remaining chance.
Some online hangman games may also have a time limit or a limit on the number of guesses, or have an option to have multiple players take turns guessing.
